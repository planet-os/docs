## REST API
Planet OS provides a RESTful API for programmatically accessing data at specific locations. Documentation and resources for this API are included below.

## Limits
Data access is limited by both call rate and transfer volume per user. For details on individual plans, see our [pricing page](http://data.planetos.com/plans).

Free accounts are limited to **100 REST API calls per day** and **5 GB of data transfer per month**.

If your workflow or application requires access that exceeds these limits, please contact [help@planetos.com](mailto:help@planetos.com).
